# Simple Password Cracker (Brute-Force)

## Project Description

A simple Python-based **password brute-force cracker** that tries to guess a password by systematically testing every possible combination of characters. This tool demonstrates a basic **brute-force attack**, useful for educational purposes to understand how weak passwords can be cracked.

### Features:
- Tries all combinations of characters (lowercase, uppercase, numbers) to match the target password.
- Displays the time taken to crack the password.
- Implements a simple brute-force approach using Python's `itertools.product`.

## Project Requirements

This project is built using **Python 3**. The following is required to run the code:

- **Python 3**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Python Libraries**: The script uses Python's built-in libraries, so no additional packages need to be installed.
  - `itertools`
  - `time`

---

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-password-cracker.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Go to the folder where you cloned the repository:
   ```bash
   cd simple-password-cracker
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Ensure Python 3 is installed, and simply run the `password_cracker.py` script:
   ```bash
   python password_cracker.py
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Modify the Target Password**:
   In the script, change the `target` variable to the password you want to crack. For example:
   ```python
   target = "password123"
   ```

2. **Run the Password Cracker**:
   Run the script by executing:
   ```bash
   python password_cracker.py
   ```

3. **Monitor the Output**:
   The script will print the attempts as it runs through the combinations. Once the password is cracked, you will see:
   ```
   Password cracked: password123
   Time taken: X seconds
   ```

## How the Code Works

The script uses a brute-force method to attempt to guess the correct password. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Key Components:
1. **Imports**:
   - `itertools.product`: Generates all possible combinations of characters.
   - `time`: Measures how long it takes to crack the password.

2. **Brute-Force Function**:
   ```python
   def brute_force(target_password):
       chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"
       length = 1
       while True:
           for attempt in itertools.product(chars, repeat=length):
               guess = ''.join(attempt)
               print(f"Trying: {guess}")
               if guess == target_password:
                   return guess
           length += 1
   ```
   - The function takes the target password and tries every combination of characters, starting from length 1 and increasing.
   - Once a match is found, it returns the correct password.

3. **Main Block**:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       target = "password123"
       print("Starting brute-force...")
       start_time = time.time()
       result = brute_force(target)
       print(f"Password cracked: {result}")
       print(f"Time taken: {time.time() - start_time} seconds")
   ```

---

## Limitations

- **Slow Execution**: Since brute-force attacks check every possible combination, the process can be very slow, especially for longer passwords. The time to crack a password grows exponentially with its length.
- **Limited Character Set**: The current version only supports lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers (a-z, A-Z, 0-9). It does not account for special characters (e.g., `!@#$%`) or longer password spaces, making it inefficient for more complex passwords.
- **No Parallelism**: The script is single-threaded, so it can only process one guess at a time. It would be much faster if parallelism or multi-threading were implemented.

---

## Potential Improvements

1. **Expand Character Set**: 
   Include special characters like `!@#$%^&*()` in the character set to support cracking more complex passwords.
   
2. **Optimize with Multi-threading**: 
   Use Python’s `threading` or `multiprocessing` libraries to divide the work into multiple threads or processes, speeding up the brute-force process.

3. **Improve Reporting**: 
   Instead of printing every guess, output the status in a more user-friendly way (e.g., a progress bar).

4. **Rainbow Tables**: 
   Implement a more advanced method of cracking using precomputed hash values (if the password is hashed).
